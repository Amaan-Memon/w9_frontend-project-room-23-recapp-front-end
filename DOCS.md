# Welcome to the RECAPP Docs!

 - **INTRO**
    
    Greetings! This is the documentation for Recapp, an application created to provide useful resources and information for School of Code Bootcampers who may be feeling overwhelmed by the immensity of information available on the internet. 
    
    It provides a more curated, relevent array of resources based on what week of the bootcamp the user is on, as well as helpful glossary terms, and a set of links to practice sites. 

    These docs will guide you through setting up the App in development mode, and then delve into the functionality of the code. Finally, we set out the styling conventions to allow you to create consistent designs within new components and pages. We recommend this order so that you will become familiar with the project strucuture- then as you begin coding, you will be able to see your changes in real time.

 - **PROJECT INFORMATION**

    * Front-end created with React JS.
    * Back-end uses Express, Nodemon, and PostgreSQL.
    * To create, populate and test your database, we recommend using Heroku and Postman, but these are not neccessary.

 - **SETTING UP**

    * *CREATING THE DATABASE*

        For security purposes, we do not include our database credentials, so you will need to create your own. We recommend using Heroku Postgres, which you can read more about here:

        https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql

        Create an account if you haven't already, create a new App, and select Heroku Postgres as an add-on. Then, from settings, access your Database Credentials. We will be using these later.

    * *CREATING A NEW TABLE* 

        Clone this repository and open it up in your favourite code editor. Our project is split into two main folders: 'backend' and 'recapp-app'.

        Navigate into the 'backend' folder, and install the required node modules.

        ```
        Noahs-MacBook-Air:w9_frontend-project-room-23-recapp-front-end noahaldhous$ cd backend
        Noahs-MacBook-Air:backend noahaldhous$ npm i
        ```
        

 * Adding your credentials
 * Populating the Database
 * Running the backend
 * Starting the frontend
