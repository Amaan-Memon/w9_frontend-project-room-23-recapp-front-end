# Welcome to the RECAPP Docs!

 - INTRO
    
    Greetings! This is the documentation for Recapp, an application created to provide useful resources and information for School of Code Bootcampers who may be feeling overwhelmed by the immensity of information available on the internet. 
    
    It provides a more curated, relevent array of resources based on what week of the bootcamp the user is on, as well as helpful glossary terms, and a set of links to practice sites. Recapp was made by Amanda, Amaan, Mateusz, Hassan, and Noah, on week 9 of SoC Bootcamp 12.

    These docs will guide you through setting up the App in development mode, and then delve into the functionality of the code. We recommend this order so that you will become familiar with the project strucuture, and then as you begin coding, you will be able to see your changes in real time.
